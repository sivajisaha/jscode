#Excel like filter on HTML table using Javascript

This is an attempt to simulate filtering capability in MS Excel sheet on HTML using Javascript. Initially i thought this is quite a common ask , but was bit surprised when i googled around this capability and found virtually none useful!!

There is one snippet at http://embed.plnkr.co/w4z9A4/ ,which is good but quite basic in nature and does not handle scenarios like duplicate values etc.

The one i created here basically extends from above piece and provides a more workable solution.

The single file filtertest.hml contains everything for a quick download and checking. I also put a tiny Excel file testfilter.xlsx which has same data as in HTML and can be referred for quick comparison for different data scenario.

This is first iteration of the code, understand this has a room for lot of improvement , in terms of further code optimization and may be fixing some bugs as well.

Pls feel free to reuse it and modify as necessary. I will be happy and eager to get a feedback :-). And finally this is my first attempt on using Github , so still learning its collaboration features , hoping people come here and start tweaking on this repository itself, need to further those capability :-)
